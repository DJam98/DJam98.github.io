# Design Choices

For this final project, the abstract adjective I chose was playful, and then I paired this with the interactive method of feedback. Going into this project, I had an idea of what I wanted to do. I intended to create a site where the user could click on a box, and that box would then enlarge and play some music that applied to the box selected (with each box representing a mood). 


Luckily, my planning and previous experiences gave me some foresight in approaching this task. In a project I've completed previously, I had some issues having music play immediately when loading a new page, so I decided to make the entire site work on a single page. Following this also led me to choose to operate all of the site elements via the flex position, as it allowed the elements to be centred with each other and then assign themselves to the centre when the other boxes disappeared when an element was clicked.


To make the website fun, I added three elements to the site. The first was the colour scheme. Throughout the site, I used soft gradients, with the only exception of the colour white. This allows users to perceive the site as fun, particularly as the primary colour of the site is a purple gradient, which is often portrayed as fun and creative ([Gregory Ciotti, 2020] (https://www.helpscout.com/blog/psychology-of-color/#:~:text=so%20unwaveringly%20shallow%3F-,What%20is%20color%20psychology%3F,brands%20or%20make%20a%20purchase.). In a similar fashion, I also chose the [MVB Grenadine font](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/mvb-grenadine) due to it's childish and playful manner.


The final key aspect of making the website fun was adding some gamification to the site by providing some interactive feedback whenever the user's mouse hovers over the mood boxes on the page. By giving this interaction that dynamically adjusts to whatever the user does, it provides a short, fun experience for the user.


Other than this feature, I've also implemented a few other pieces to give the user feedback while on the page. The first and most noticeable one is that the box expands whenever the user hovers over one of the emotion boxes. Not only does this indicate to the user that an action will occur when clicked, but it also allows the box to be bigger for the gamification feature of the site (mentioned in the previous paragraph). Alongside this, I made sure that whenever an action could occur by clicking something, to change the cursor so that feedback would be provided for this, including pausing the music while it was playing.
