            <h2>Questions</h2>

            <a href=https://ritwickdey.github.io/#!/ target="_blank">IS THE SITE I'M REFERENCING</a>

            <ol>

                <!--Question 1-->
                <li>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</li>
                <ul>
                    The animations of the site. The instantly drew my attention.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 2-->
                <li>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hover over multiple elements of the site, and spend a while doing so</li>
                    <li>Click explore me, then hit the first option at the top of the list (portfolio)</li>
                    <li>Explore and view the details on multiple of the projects he's worked on.</li>
                </ul>

                <!--Question 3-->
                <li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</li>
                <ul>
                    The animations
                </ul>

                <!--Question 4-->
                <li>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</li>
                <ul>
                    Clicking on buttons.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 5-->
                <li>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</li>
                <ul>
                    Successfully converys that this is indeed a website to showcase off Ritwick's portfolio, as the hierarchical order of the website directs users to view his projects.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 6-->
                <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</li>
                <ul>
                    I feel like the sheer amount of animations on the website takes away partly from the experience of showing off that this is a protfolio. Yet despite this, because of the large quantity of animations it does show off Ritwick's skill in the field. But the actual navigation of the site is seemless, and very clear to the user about which direction they should be going in.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 7-->
                <li>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</li>
                <ul>
                    While the design of the site is nice for the initial landing because of the site, the somewhat bland use of fonts and colours do subtract from long term viewing of the site from a casual viewing. If you're intentionally going to his site to find information, you'll quickly find what you're looking for and will be able to easily come back if you need to find more.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 8-->
                <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</li>
                <ul>
                    It seems that this site should be used in short bursts, rather than over a long duration of time, as the objective is to find information on Dey.
                </ul>
