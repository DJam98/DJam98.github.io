            <section>    
                <h2>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
                <ul>
                    The animations of the site. They instantly drew my attention.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 2-->
                <h2>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hover over multiple elements of the site, and spend a while doing so</li>
                    <li>Click explore me, then hit the first option at the top of the list (portfolio)</li>
                    <li>Explore and view the details of the projects he's worked on.</li>

            <section>
                <!--Question 3-->
                <h2>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
                <ul>
                    The experience I enjoyed most was playing and hovering over the animations.                
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="right">
                <!--Question 4-->
                <h2>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
                <ul>
                    I spent the most time navigating the site by pushing buttons.
                </ul>

            <section>
                <!--Question 5-->
                <h2>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
                <ul>
                    Successfully conveys that this is indeed a website to showcase Ritwick's portfolio, as the hierarchical order of the website directs users to view his projects.
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <section class="right">
                <!--Question 6-->
                <h2>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h2>
                <ul>
                    The sheer amount of animations on the website takes away partly from the experience of showing off that this is a portfolio. Yet despite this, because of the large number of animations, it does show off Ritwick's skill in the field. But the actual navigation of the site is seamless and very clear to the user about which direction they should be going in.

                <!--Question 7-->
                <h2>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h2>
                <ul>
                    While the site's design is excellent for the initial landing because of the site, the somewhat bland use of fonts and colours subtracts from long-term viewing of the site from casual viewing. If you're intentionally going to Dey's site to find information, you'll quickly find what you're looking for and can come back if you need to find more.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 8-->
                <h2>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
                <ul>
                    This site should be used in short bursts rather than over a long duration, as the objective is to find information on Dey.

<!-- WEEK 3 QUESTIONS-->

                <!--Question 9-->
                <h2>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>
                <ul>
                    It references Dey's other works and reflects the styles he has used in previous projects. Styles that remain consistent across all of his previous projects, including this website, consisting of a grid-like when laying out the site, standard solid colours for the backgrounds and other elements of the site, as well as traditional (or traditional looking) font, faces.
                    <br>
                    Other parts of the site use two main ideas referenced throughout the page: a signpost and providing a guide to the user, as well as flip cards usually seen on business cards.
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <section class="right">
                <!--Question 10-->
                <h2>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?  </h2>
                <ul>
                    It reinforces how this portfolio website reflects all of their works since they're incorporating similar design aesthetics that appear in their other works, enhancing how this site is about him.
                </ul>

            <section>
                <!--Question 11-->
                <h2>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h2>
                <ul>
                    It's a very emotionally bland website, with the main flairs of the site being the animations and curves of the background. Due to this, the user isn't left with any particular positive or negative emotions from viewing the site; instead, it's just neutral. Because of this, and the references to flip cards, it also gives off the impression of being professional as this site would be referred to as a somewhat online business card.
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <section class="right">
                <!--Question 12-->
                <h2>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h2>
                <ul>
                    The most frustrating element of this site is how overbearing the animations are. When you're on the homepage, you don't get a moment to breathe as there is always an animation happening on screen.
                    <br>
                    Another element of the site that is frustrating to me is that whenever a button is clicked that goes to another 'page', it constantly scrolls right. The homepage should go back left, or there should be some other directions to make it feel like you've correctly 'returned home' rather than continuously going right, which makes it feel like you're going on an endless journey.
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <section class="final">
                <!--Question 13-->
                <h2>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h2>
                <ul>
                    There are two satisfying elements of the site that I enjoy. The first one is what you see straight up, which is the signpost on the homepage. While it's a direct metaphor, it's an excellent way to put it all there and is easier to decipher.
                    <br>
                    The second part is that when you hover over one of the projects on the portfolio page, it flips over like a card to give a little bit more information, and then when you click on it, even more information appears. I like this because it has a lovely aesthetic and fits the site's design. It also is very intuitive as the user instinctively knows where to go when navigating this part of the website.
