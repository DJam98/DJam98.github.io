            <h2>Questions</h2>

            <a href=https://ritwickdey.github.io/#!/ target="_blank">IS THE SITE I'M REFERENCING</a>

            <ol>

                <!--Question 1-->
                <li>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</li>
                <ul>
                    The animations of the site. The instantly drew my attention.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 2-->
                <li>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hover over multiple elements of the site, and spend a while doing so</li>
                    <li>Click explore me, then hit the first option at the top of the list (portfolio)</li>
                    <li>Explore and view the details on multiple of the projects he's worked on.</li>
                </ul>

                <!--Question 3-->
                <li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</li>
                <ul>
                    The animations
                </ul>

                <!--Question 4-->
                <li>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</li>
                <ul>
                    Clicking on buttons.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 5-->
                <li>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</li>
                <ul>
                    Successfully converys that this is indeed a website to showcase off Ritwick's portfolio, as the hierarchical order of the website directs users to view his projects.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 6-->
                <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</li>
                <ul>
                    I feel like the sheer amount of animations on the website takes away partly from the experience of showing off that this is a protfolio. Yet despite this, because of the large quantity of animations it does show off Ritwick's skill in the field. But the actual navigation of the site is seemless, and very clear to the user about which direction they should be going in.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 7-->
                <li>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</li>
                <ul>
                    While the design of the site is nice for the initial landing because of the site, the somewhat bland use of fonts and colours do subtract from long term viewing of the site from a casual viewing. If you're intentionally going to his site to find information, you'll quickly find what you're looking for and will be able to easily come back if you need to find more.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 8-->
                <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</li>
                <ul>
                    It seems that this site should be used in short bursts, rather than over a long duration of time, as the objective is to find information on Dey.
                </ul>

<!-- WEEK 3 QUESTIONS-->

                <!--Question 9-->
                <li>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</li>
                <ul>
                    It's very much a reference of Dey's other works and very reflective of the styles that he has used in previous projects. Styles that remain consistent across all of his previous projects, including this website consist of a grid-like when laying out the site, standard solid colours for the backgrouds and other elements of the site as well as traditional (or traditional looking) font faces.
                    <br>
                    Other parts of the site use two main ideas that are referenced throughout the page; those being a signpost and providing a guide to the user, as well as flipcards that are usually seen on buisness cards.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 10-->
                <li>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?  </li>
                <ul>
                    It just reinforces how this portfolio website is a reflection of all of their works, due to the fact that they're incorporating a similar design aesthetics that appeearing their other works which just enhances how this is a site about him.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 11-->
                <li>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</li>
                <ul>
                    It's a very emotionally bland website, with the main flairs of the site being the animations and curves of the background. Due to this, the user isn't really left with any particular positive or negativ emotions from viewing the site, rather it's just netural. Because of this, and the references to flipcards, it also gives off the impression of being profressional as this is a site that would be refered to as a somewhat online buisness card.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 12-->
                <li>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</li>
                <ul>
                    The most fustrating element of this site is the fact of how overbearing the animations are. The fact that when you're on the homepage, you don't really get a moment to breath as there is always an animation happening on sceen.
                    <br>
                    One more element of the site that is fustrating to me is the fact that whenever a button is clicked that goes to another 'page' is that it always scrolls right. I feel like the homepage should go back left, or that there should be some other directions to make it feel like you've properly 'returned home', rather than continuously going right which makes it feel like you're going on an endless journey.
                </ul>

                <!--Question 13-->
                <li>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</li>
                <ul>
                    There are two satisfying elements of the site that I really enjoy. The first one is what you see straight up, which is the signpost on the homepage. While it's a very direct metaphore, it's a nice way to put it all there and easier to decipher.
                    <br>
                    The second part is that on the portfolio page, is that I really like how when you hover over one of the projects, it flips over like a card to give a little bit more information, and then when you click on it even more information appears. I really like this because not only is it a nice aesthetic and fits in with the design of the site, it also is very intuative the user instictivly knows where to go when navigating this part of the website.
                </ul>
            </ol>
